At irst, my computer system is `Windows10`and it is 64 bit. 
Use Git to clone the source of Hadley Wickham's **Advanced R Programming**.

```{r eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/hadley/adv-r.git
```

Later,In order to compile Advanced R into a PDF, I installed the MiKTex and Rmarkdown packages  before compiling

### Install R Package dependencies
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hadley/sloop")
devtools::install_github("hadley/emo")
```

Finanlly, i use `bookdown` package to compile the book.
```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::pdf_book")
```

During the building process, I've met several problems, the followings are the errors I've met and how I solved them. 

## Unable to load devtools package

Execute the following command in Git.
```{r eval=FALSE}
$ git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl"
$ git config --global http.sslCAInfo [path to .pem file] 
```

# Failed to install "emo" from Github:

```{r fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/dell/Desktop/adv-r/error/2.PNG")
```

To solve this problem,I executed the following command in Git.
```{r eval=FALSE}
$ git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl"
$ git config --global http.sslCAInfo E:/R/R-3.6.1/library/openssl/cacert.pem 
```

# Missing Packages
Most of the warnings are packages missing. Use install.packages() to solve these problems. The packages I installed during the process are lubridate, purr, stringing, Rcpp, tinytex, dbplyr, etc.

# Fonts cannot be found

```{r fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/dell/Desktop/adv-r/error/4.PNG")
```

I downloaded the font `Inconsolate` and `Andale Mono` copied it to `C:\Windows\Fonts`

After solving these problems, i built the book successfully .
